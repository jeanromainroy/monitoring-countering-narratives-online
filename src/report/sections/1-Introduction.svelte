    <p>
        Access to the tools of mass communication is now widespread. Broadcasting a message to an arbitrary audience 
        is within everyone's reach. It can be done quickly and anonymously. The modern newsroom is multipolar and 
        largely unaccountable. As backdrop, digital literacy and algorithms governing the “who sees what” are still 
        in an embryonic stage. As a result, online forums are plagued with opportunistic and perverse ideologies. 
        Thus far, regulatory bodies and hegemonic social media platforms have failed to deliver adequate safeguards.

        This report lays out a practical and complete blueprint to counter narratives online. The methodology
        is elementary to be operationalizable in most contexts. It should be regarded as a skeleton to 
        build upon.

        Our dissection begins with the tools and processes required to examine online discourse and profile narratives. 
        Subsequently, we cover how to use the findings to support the countering programme. Finally, we deconceptualize 
        the playbook by providing a detailed account of how we implemented it in Bolsonaro’s Brazil and Ouattara’s 
        third term Ivory Coast.

        Our hope is that this exposé brings to light the vulnerabilities of these platforms, strengthens intervention efforts and 
        catalyzes policy making.
